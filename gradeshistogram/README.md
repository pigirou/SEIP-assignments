## Histogram Generator 

The purpose of this assignment is to take advantage of "Maven" as a Build Automation Tool. In this module, an executable .jar is created. Using this jar, the program reads a file consisting of grades in each line of the file and afterwards generates a histogram with both the grades and their frequency of occurrence in the file. 

## How to build
1. Set up Java in your PC and generate the appropriate paths. 
2. Set up Maven and the appropriate paths.
3. Clone the repository on your computer.
4. Make the jar file using the command mvn package. 
5. The produced jar is located in the target directory and can be executed as following:
java -jar histogramgenerator/target/histogramgenerator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
